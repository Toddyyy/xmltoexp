The MIDI postprocessing and rendering process uses Logic Pro. The MIDI information is imported to the application and a
“Velocity processor” is applied to control the distribution of note velocities. The rendering soundfont is based on the
“Steinway Grand Piano” patch available in Logic Pro with additional reverb effect and audio dynamic compressor added to
ensure the rendered audio resembles an authentic recording.

Rendering proceedure：

1. Open the “MIREX RENDER.logicx” file using Logic Pro X 10.5.1 or above
2. Copy an existing “RENDER” track to create a new empty track
3. Drag and drop the desired MIDI file to the empty track
4. Click “Yes” to all import dialogs
